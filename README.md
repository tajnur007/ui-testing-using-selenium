# ui-testing-using-selenium
This repository serves as a dedicated space for practicing and improving UI testing skills using <strong>Selenium WebDriver</strong>. It provides a simple starting point for individuals who want to dive into UI testing and gain hands-on experience with Selenium WebDriver.

## Key Features and Purpose:
  - <strong>Learning UI Testing:</strong> The primary goal of this repository is to facilitate learning and skill development in UI testing. By leveraging Selenium WebDriver, you can gain practical knowledge of automating tests on web applications' user interfaces.
  - <strong>Hands-on Practice:</strong> This repository encourages hands-on practice by providing a pre-configured setup for UI testing with Selenium WebDriver. It offers a foundation for writing and executing UI test scripts, allowing you to practice test automation techniques specific to the user interface.
  - <strong>Test Case Development:</strong> This repository emphasizes the creation and execution of test cases that target different UI elements, interactions, and scenarios. It encourages you to explore various functionalities of Selenium WebDriver, such as locating elements, interacting with forms, validating UI behavior, and handling user inputs.
  - <strong>Test Framework Exploration:</strong> As you progress, you can extend the repository to include test frameworks such as Mocha or Mochawesome. These frameworks enable better test organization, test suite creation, test execution, and reporting capabilities, providing a more comprehensive testing solution.
  - <strong>Collaboration and Community Engagement:</strong> This repository is open for collaboration, allowing others to contribute, provide feedback, and share their own UI testing practices. It serves as a platform for knowledge exchange, fostering a community of UI testing enthusiasts and practitioners. Checkout <a href="#contributingGuide">Contributing Guide</a>
  - <strong>Documentation and Resources:</strong> The repository includes documentation and resources to support your learning journey. This includes guidance on setting up the development environment, usage instructions for running tests, and best practices for writing effective UI test scripts using Selenium WebDriver.


# Project Setup
Open your terminal/command prompt where you want to setup this project. Create a directory using command `mkdir ui-testing-using-selenium`, navigate to the directory using command `cd ui-testing-using-selenium`. Now initialize your project setup using command `npm init -y`, this command will create a `package.json` file with some default configuration, if you want to add manually then skip the `-y` flag.

Now we will install `selenium-webdriver` and `chromedriver` into our project, run `npm install selenium-webdriver chromedriver`. I'm using Google Chrome browser for testing, if you want to use Firefox or Safari then install `geckodriver` or `safaridriver` respectively instead of `chromedriver`. Now we have finished our project setup.
